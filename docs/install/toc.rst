SteelScript Installation
========================

Installation of SteelScript varies depending on the platform you are using.
Start with the specific instructions for :doc:`Linux or Mac OS <linuxmac>` or
:doc:`Windows <windows>` for greater detail.

Getting the Application Framework running takes a few additional steps in some
cases, but can usually be done with one command, ``steel install --appfwk``.
See the :doc:`App Framework installation instructions <appfwk>` for more
details.
